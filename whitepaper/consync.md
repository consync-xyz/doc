     > An Atomical Swap can take place between any ARC20, NFT or regular Satoshis. <br>
  For example, the following direct transfers are possible, it is up to the seller to define how they would like to receive payment and in what other Atomical token type (if any)<br>
    Possible direct swaps:<br>
    ARC20  <--> Satoshis<br>
    ARC20  <--> ARC20<br>
    ARC20  <--> NFT<br>
    NFT       <--> Satoshis<br>
    NFT       <--> NFT<br>
    NFT       <--> ARC20<br>
