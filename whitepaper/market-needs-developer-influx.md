### Market Needs and Developer Influx
With the market's demand for new narratives and Bitcoin's halving event on the horizon, the ecosystem's development has become increasingly crucial. The growth of the Bitcoin ecosystem can bring substantial transaction fees, supporting miners and maintaining network security. This aligns with Satoshi Nakamoto's original vision for Bitcoin.

The influx of developers into the Bitcoin ecosystem, driven by market prospects and wealth effects, has been a notable trend. From Ordinals to BTC Layer 2, a growing number of developers, including those from other blockchain ecosystems like Solana and BSV, have been contributing to Bitcoin's technical advancement.
